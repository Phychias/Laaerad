# <ruby>Laaerad<rt>Laaerad</rt></ruby> — Basic Setting

Laaerad is a unique world that skillfully fuses hard science fiction concepts with traditional fantasy elements. It features not only a mysterious **Magic Star Ring**, but also a magic system grounded in a complex cosmological theory. In this world, the course of history and the development of civilizations are closely linked to astronomical phenomena and magical events, together shaping a universe full of mystery and exploration.

## Astronomy

From an astronomical perspective, **Laaerad** is a planet very similar to Earth in terms of mass and volume, with comparable gravity and climate, allowing for diverse ecosystems and intelligent life. It orbits its own star and has a single natural satellite, and its galactic environment is similar to the Solar System.

The most remarkable feature of this planet is a glowing **Magic Star Ring** encircling its orbit. The ring is not only a striking feature in the night sky but also an indicator of the intensity at which “magic” manifests in the world. When visible, it reflects sunlight and illuminates the heavens, usually appearing as bright as the Moon, sometimes displaying hues of purple-red or gray-green. During the day, depending on its relative position to the Sun, observers may even witness a rare phenomenon known as “dual suns in the sky.”

## Magic

Magic in Laaerad follows these principles:

Beyond “reality” exists a higher-dimensional space. The real world is mapped into this space as a **snapshot**, a unique and reversible representation containing not only spatial information but also the flow of time. Magic occurs when a caster opens a channel between reality and a chosen snapshot, causing the current state of reality to collapse toward that snapshot. During this collapse, energy, matter, and fluctuations exchange between the two.

Periodically, when the large-scale rotation of reality aligns closely with a mapped position in the higher-dimensional space, the Magic Star Ring appears in the sky. During these periods, most magic becomes ineffective. These cycles can range from several hundred years to multiple occurrences within a single day.

### Forms

Magic in Laaerad manifests in various forms:

- **Enchantments (uru)**  
    By binding an “element” to an object’s high-dimensional mapping, the object gains abilities beyond its physical properties. For example, an enchanted sword may cut through non-material substances, and enchanted clothing can shield against extreme temperatures. The stability of enchantments depends on the caster’s mastery of element purity and compatibility; if the binding process falters, the item may fail or even harm the wielder.
    
- **Blessings (anhuz)**  
    These overlay an ideal state from a snapshot onto a target, enhancing life force, luck, or mental state. Blessings are commonly used in rituals such as pre-battle ceremonies, weddings, or harvest festivals, and are often minor in effect. Many ethnic groups in Laaerad maintain customs related to blessings.
    
- **Prophecy (portesdra)**  
    Rare and difficult to master, prophecy selectively reads information from a snapshot to predict possible future outcomes. Since snapshots exist in higher dimensions and are not fixed, what a caster sees may be fragmented or distorted, and the process can strain the mind, potentially causing a loss of perception of reality.
    
- **Spirit Communication (strahuy)**  
    Certain mages or _linguists of spirits_ who have ventured into higher-dimensional space may leave traces of themselves there. Others can explore these traces to glean thoughts from predecessors—or even from successors.
    

Regardless of form, magic requires the acquisition of specific “elements,” which may include materials, energy, symbols, or environmental conditions. Reproducibility depends on whether the caster can precisely locate and obtain these elements each time.

### Mechanism

In Laaerad, a “mage” is someone who can perceive the **snapshot** in higher-dimensional space. A caster’s strength largely depends on their ability to observe snapshots. This ability is extremely rare—newborns only occasionally inherit it when the higher-dimensional mapping coincides with reality in certain ways. Although it appears to be partly hereditary, the sample size is too small to establish clear rules.

Perceiving snapshots does not guarantee accurate element localization, and vice versa. Even those skilled at both may lose the ability to cast if they cannot open the channel between reality and higher space. Meditation can enhance this connection, though effects vary among individuals.

**Example: Enchanting a sword with fire**

1. The sword exists as a physical object in reality.
    
2. The mage observes its snapshot and opens a channel.
    
3. In the snapshot, fire exists as a static state; the mage must locate the elements forming fire and bind them to the sword’s mapping, making fire manifest in reality.
    

While this superficially resembles typical fantasy magic, in Laaerad, magical effects and strength depend on the relative positions of reality and snapshots. By observing celestial movements, people can predict periods of high or low magical efficacy, and magic may even fail completely. Thus, Laaerad could host highly advanced magical civilizations or societies with little magical knowledge.

This system provides a scientifically coherent foundation for magic while leaving space for sci-fi storytelling.

## Cultural Foundation

### History

`%%{init: { 'logLevel': 'debug', 'theme': 'dark' } }%% timeline     title Laaerad Timeline     section Mythical Era 	    BC 20 : Records of Proto-Laaerad language     section Cataclysm Era         Early : Glacial migrations         : Human tribes disperse         Late : Geological activity stabilizes         : Early settlements appear 	section Medieval Era 		Early : City-state period 		Late : Early empire period`

#### Mythical Era (Stone Age) — _porurmart_

**Overview**

During a warm, stable climate, high sea levels covered much of the continental margins, leaving limited land area. Terrestrial flora and fauna were diverse, and early humans and other intelligent species thrived in temperate and coastal zones.

Humans appeared approximately 100,000 years before the end of the Mythical Era and gradually spread across temperate regions and coasts. Around 20 years before the end of this era, the **Proto-Laaerad language** was first recorded in stone—roughly 200 words etched into rocks, representing the oldest surviving linguistic artifacts.

During this period, the _Porurka_ pantheon was prominent, and myths, language, and nature worship were closely intertwined, forming the spiritual core of early society.

Near the end of the era, a figure later called the “Gate Opener” discovered a **Snapshot Gate** connecting to the early universe. This marked the beginning of human exploration into higher-dimensional space, setting the foundation for both magic and advanced civilization.

#### Cataclysm Era — _Karthruk_

**Overview**

As the planet experienced tectonic instability and glacial fluctuations, humans were forced into migrations, forming scattered tribes. Many early settlements were abandoned due to natural disasters.

During this era, humans gradually learned to interpret astronomical signals in relation to snapshots, and rudimentary magical practices began. These discoveries, combined with environmental pressures, accelerated the formation of early cities and regional governance systems.

#### Medieval Era — _Zyrrath_

**Overview**

By this era, stable empires had begun to emerge. City-states competed for resources and knowledge, while magic became formalized through academies and guilds. Cultural diversity flourished as different ethnic groups developed distinct magical traditions.

**Magic in society** was stratified: elite scholars controlled most powerful enchantments, while commoners had access mainly to blessings and minor enchantments. Prophecy and spirit communication remained rare and often linked to political authority or religious institutions.

---

### Languages

The Proto-Laaerad language evolved during the Mythical Era, and multiple dialects emerged as humans migrated. By the Medieval Era, Laaerad had a rich tapestry of languages and writing systems, some still traceable in ancient inscriptions and magical texts.

### Summary

Laaerad is thus a world where hard science and fantasy coexist. Its magic system is grounded in higher-dimensional physics, while civilization is shaped by astronomical cycles and environmental pressures. The planet’s unique features—the **Magic Star Ring**, snapshots, and periodic alignment of reality—allow both scientific inquiry and mystical exploration, creating a fertile setting for stories blending science fiction, magic, and cultural depth.
