# Kuileot

**Kuileot** is a concept from ancient **Trusk**, representing both the first monarch in **Trusk's** recorded history and the name of the dynasty he established, which lasted for about eight hundred years. The word itself holds multiple meanings in the **Trusk** language and history, possibly referring to a deity or wealth, and eventually becoming a symbol of royal power.

## Etymology

There are several hypotheses regarding the origin of the word **Kuileot**:

- **A Deity's Name**: One theory suggests that a city-state conquered by early **Trusk** once worshipped a deity named **Kuileot**. During the long process of unification, this deity's name gradually became a collective term for the nobles of that city-state. However, this name does not appear in later **Trusk**-Heimet mythologies, and thus this hypothesis lacks direct evidence.
    
- **The Meaning of Gold**: Another mainstream view is that in ancient **Trusk**, **Kuileot** originally meant "gold." The word may have initially been a collective term for merchants who frequently used gold as currency. Some of these merchants later became key political strategists who played a significant role in the wars that unified the **Trusk** Empire.
    
- **An Alias for "King"**: An alternative explanation based on the "gold" hypothesis is that **Kuileot** was a title for "King," symbolizing "the person with the most gold in the world."
    

All these theories point to one **fact**: during the ancient **Trusk** city-state era, **Kuileot** represented a significant political force with immense influence, which eventually coalesced into the person of **King Kuileot** himself.

## King Kuileot

**King Kuileot** is the first documented monarch of **Trusk**. Before his reign, the **Trusk** civilization seemingly had no custom of recording history. However, some scholars speculate that even older rulers may have existed, but their records might have been lost due to a catastrophic event.

According to excavated inscriptions, **Kuileot** collected treasures, issued decrees, and built palaces during his reign. One of his most significant achievements was launching the decisive **Heimet War**. Although the inscriptions do not detail the war, they mention that it "nearly exhausted" the treasures he had collected, suggesting its brutal nature. After conquering Heimet, **Kuileot** became the joint ruler of all city-states along the two great rivers from **Trusk** to the strait, laying the foundation for the **Trusk** Empire.

## The Dynasty of Kuileot

The dynasty established by **Kuileot** lasted for about eight hundred years and is known to later generations as the **Kuileot Dynasty**. Interestingly, the names of the first few kings who succeeded him bore no relation to **Kuileot**, such as one named "Roast Man" (leukkiap). It was not until the fourth king that the name **Kuileot** was prefixed to all monarchs' names, and the dynasty thus earned its name.

The social and economic foundation of this period was relatively primitive. Agricultural productivity was limited, insufficient to sustain a long and stable rule. Incursions by barbarian tribes were frequent, and material exchange had yet to form a mature trade system. Although the core political system was maintained, the inscriptions regarding royal succession are vague, making it impossible to determine whether it was a system of hereditary succession or some form of abdication. This unstable foundation created hidden dangers for the dynasty's decline.

Like many ancient dynasties, the end of the **Kuileot Dynasty** was due to a combination of internal and external factors. Inscriptions show that the end of the dynasty may have experienced a long-term drought, which dealt a heavy blow to the already fragile agricultural base. At the same time, the legitimacy of the then-king's lineage was questioned within the court. These internal and external troubles eventually triggered a great unrest, leading to the rapid downfall of the **Kuileot Dynasty**.
