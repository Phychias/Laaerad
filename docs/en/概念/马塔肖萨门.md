# **Matasioksamen**

**Matasioksamen** is a name from Old Trusk. It is less common in Middle Trusk and sometimes appears as a surname. It often refers to **Matasioksamen Avenue**, but in these cases it is usually modified with the definite suffix _-ir_, or with _lous_ ("road") or _dzal lous_ ("avenue").

## **Etymology**

It is now speculated that "Matasioksamen" may have been a word in an evolutionary stage between Northeast Laerad language and Old Trusk. _Mata-_ could be a dialectal narrative, similar to the proto-word "_-mat_", but for some unknown reason it moved to the front of the word. "_Sioksamem_" means "wide mountain" or can be translated as "mountain ranges". The general meaning of the name is "one who lives in the mountains" or "one who comes from the mountains." Based on this understanding, the Matasioksamen father and son may have come from the Serke Mountains, the closest mountains to Heimet. It is also highly possible that Matasioksamen was not their given name but a surname, which was later mistakenly transmitted as their name throughout history, and their true names are no longer verifiable.
