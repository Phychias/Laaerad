# Glömer

The concept of Glömer has multiple meanings in the world of Laaerad. It may refer to concepts such as the **Glömer Tribe**, the **Glömer language**, or the **State of Glömer**.

## Etymology

The term **Glömer** originally means "by the river" in the Glömer language. Initially, the Trusk people used this word to refer to the Glömer tribesmen they first encountered, a clan named "Glömer." This name was later solidified as a collective term for the peoples of northern Trusk. Over time, the Glömer people themselves gradually accepted this designation, especially after the "glömer" clan was assimilated and died out.

Because the Glömer people were nomadic, following water and grass, they lacked the custom of recording history, and their origins are now untraceable. According to legend, the Glömer people were formed from the flesh and blood of the goddess Lamro and survived the Great Cataclysm under the protection of the divine mountain Kaloda.

## In Trusk Language

The word Glömer contains the front vowel _ö_, which is in opposition to _o_ in the Glömer language. The Trusk language does not have this sound, and thus it is often written as _gulomer_ in Trusk. The phonetic evolution between the two is difficult to confirm and may have arisen from cognitive differences during their initial contact.
