## Jaudziya Dynasty

The Jaudziya Dynasty was established by the long-dormant Jaudziya army, which captured Heimet City following the decline of "magic" and the chaos of the imperial court at the end of the Moswarik Dynasty. Tika I, the first monarch, attempted to advance centralizing reforms. However, his son, Yecika, triumphed in a power struggle and undermined his father's vision through the enfeoffment system, leading to the failure of the reforms. After Jaudziya·Yejika's death, the nation fractured, and the Empire of Tusk once again fell into civil unrest.
