# Heimet

**Heimet** (Old Trusk: *heimet*) is a historical and geographical concept on the continent of **Laaerad**. The term refers variously to a city, a region, a strait, and a noble family that established several dynasties. Throughout history, Heimet played a central role in the rise and fall of the **Trusk Empire**.

## Etymology

The name *heimet* derives from Proto-Laaeradic, combining the root *heim* with the locative suffix *-met*, meaning “where the sun rises.” Scholars generally agree that the Heimet region lay at the easternmost frontier of Old Truskal.

## The City of Heimet

**Heimet City** served as the political, economic, and cultural center of the region. The first settlement was founded along the old Pelnan River but was later destroyed by floods. It was subsequently rebuilt south of Mount Serk, near Heimet Bay. During the **Reforms of Matasioksamen**, the construction of **Matasioksamen Avenue** connected Heimet with the Trusk Basin, strengthening its role as the empire’s core.

## The Region of Heimet

The **Heimet Region** refers to the wider geographical and cultural area surrounding the city. It has consistently been a decisive commercial, political, and military hub in Trusk history.

Situated at the heart of eastern Truskal, the region faces the **Novaja Sea** and commands the **Heimet Strait**, which links the Novaja Sea to both the **Northern Sea** and the **Southern Sea**. Its landscape consists largely of fertile plains and rolling hills, making it one of the most prosperous areas of the continent.

### History

#### City-State Era
Early Heimet city-states were located north of Mount Serk, but floods destroyed them. The later city was rebuilt south of the mountain along the Pelnan River, near Heimet Bay. Its strategic location enabled it to grow into the foremost northern port, laying the economic foundation for Heimet’s later dominance.

#### First Heimet Dynasty
In the late **Kuileot Dynasty**, **Matasioksamen** led a Heimet army to overthrow the old regime and establish the **First Heimet Dynasty**. From then on, Heimet became the capital of the Trusk Empire. The Matasioksamen Avenue facilitated movement between the Heimet Strait and the Trusk Basin, integrating trade and communication across the empire.

#### Imperial Era
Under the **Second Tyesuku Dynasty**, the Heimet region was elevated to the **Kingdom of Heimet**, ruled by the emperor or his designated **Prince of Heimet**. As the empire’s core territory, its taxes went directly to the imperial treasury, while its forces (the **Heimet Guard** and the **Imperial Guard**) were jointly controlled by the prince and the emperor. The capital attracted goods, culture, and technology from across the empire, becoming the continent’s civilizational center.

## Culture and Economy

Heimet was the cradle of Trusk commercial culture. Its harbors, shipbuilding, and “magical” navigation technology turned it into the bridge between East and West. This environment fostered a spirit of freedom, adventure, and exploration.  

Religiously, Heimet was also the center of **Sea God worship**. Matasioksamen’s reforms elevated the Sea God within a polytheistic system of six major deities, establishing the ideological basis of the empire. The doctrine of divine kingship developed here strongly influenced Trusk political legitimacy.

## Heimet Strait

The **Heimet Strait** is the region’s defining geographical feature. It is a strategic waterway linking the Novaja Sea with the Northern Sea. Control over the strait provided dynasties with commercial and military dominance.  

The strait is the only Novaja Sea passage with a deep-water harbor unaffected by currents and never frozen. By contrast, the southern Laporio Strait suffers from storms and weaker deep-water zones. These natural advantages gave Heimet unrivaled maritime supremacy, particularly in the Novaja Sea.

## The House of Heimet

The **House of Heimet** was one of the most powerful noble families in Trusk history, its influence closely tied to the prosperity of trade. During the late Quileo period, Heimet City’s harbor allowed the family to accumulate immense wealth and political power.

### Notable Members

- **Matasioksamen I** – Military commander and statesman, regarded as the true founder of the Heimet Dynasty.  
- **Matasioksamen II** – The first monarch of the Heimet Dynasty.

## The Prince of Heimet

The title **Prince of Heimet** was created by Emperor Decoheim III to administer the capital’s surrounding territory. Unlike other provinces governed by viceroys or feudal lords, the Principality of Heimet was organized through a bureaucratic system. The prince also commanded the capital’s garrison, reinforcing both security and imperial authority.
